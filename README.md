# Take Five Capital One Project
This was my first major project in React, for an application, coming from a background without much HTML, JavaScript, or CSS experience.

Technologies: React, JavaScript, Google Maps API, Yelp API, Bootstrap

Requirements:
- Create a web application with React
- Use Yelp Fusion API
- Plot merchants on a map
- Get user location

## Vision
The purpose of the project was to "help people pick the right restaurant". I realized that the best way to accomplish that goal is to introduce simplicity. In today's internet age, we're too often overwhelmed with information and options. I wanted to lift the burden of the paradox of choice by giving the user a limited set of options while still including the essentials.

The most important requirements for someone choosing a restaurant include
- Distance⁠— Users do not want to or cannot travel far to eat.
- Time— The restaurant has to be open when they want to eat.
- Price— Users are generally on a limited budget for food.

With these elements in mind, TakeFive gives the user the right set of options and allows them to make a decision quickly and easily.

## Conclusion
I learned so much and am satisfied with the final product. If I did it again, with less time constraint, I would have taken more time to understand the code and scale up more slowly to understand each individual part. However, the time constraint developed my ability to learn on the fly and rapidly iterate and deploy changes. That skill is in some ways more valuable than learning web development itself. I think that the final web app represents my vision well.
