# Take Five Capital One Project
Requirements:
- Create a web application on Github
- Use Yelp Fusion API
- Plot merchants on a map
- Get user location

## Vision
The purpose of the project was to "help people pick the right restaurant". I realized that the best way to accomplish that goal is to introduce simplicity. In today's internet age, we're too often overwhelmed with information and options. I wanted to lift the burden of the paradox of choice by giving the user a limited set of options while still including the essentials.

The most important requirements for someone choosing a restaurant include
- Distance⁠— Users do not want to or cannot travel far to eat.
- Time— The restaurant has to be open when they want to eat.
- Price— Users are generally on a limited budget for food.

With these elements in mind, TakeFive gives the user the right set of options and allows them to make a decision quickly and easily.

## Process
This project seemed at first like a daunting task— I had no experience in JavaScript, HTML, or CSS, or any technologies like React or APIs. However, breaking the project down into smaller parts helped me form goals and progress quickly.

### Learning React (~6 hours)
- Learned React through Codecademy course
- Picked up JavaScript along the way— I relied on my experience with Java and Python as well as thorough research to understand the syntax

### Setting up React and Github (~4 hours)
- Followed tutorials to create Github Pages website
- Studied default React app structure to understand basic layout

### Getting location of user (~2 hours)
- Used HTML5 geolocation to retrieve user location
- Eventually converted to hook

### Accessing Yelp API (~4 hours)
- Created hook to access Yelp Fusion
- Integrated geolocation retrieval into API call

### Mapping the user and restaurants (~4 hours)
- Used `google-maps-react` library to create embedded Google Maps map
- Displayed user location and markers for restaurants
- Created labels for markers on click

### Implementing CSS (~6 hours)
- Learned CSS from Codecademy course
- Added CSS to all parts of website
- Used Bootstrap for buttons and cards

### Creating selection form (~6 hours)
- Added selection for price, radius, and time of day

## Conclusion
I learned so much and am satisfied with the final product. If I did it again, with less time constraint, I would have taken more time to understand the code and scale up more slowly to undestand each individual part. However, the time constraint developed my ability to learn on the fly and rapidly iterate and deploy changes. That skill is in some ways more valuable than learning web development itself. I think that the final web app represents my vision well.
